print(f"The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very {adj1} {animal1} {verb1} down the hallway. \"{exclamation1}!\" I yelled. But all I could think to od was to {verb2} over and over. Miraculously, that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3} right in front of my family. After that, I decided to try my chances on a {sport1} team. I tried out and i ended up getting a place on the team, however, it was as the team\'s {position1}. Imagine my bad luck! I decided to quit while i was ahead and went home to my {adj2} {noun1}. When I got home, I found out that the {adj1} {animal1} had destroyed it! This day was absolutely horrible.")
